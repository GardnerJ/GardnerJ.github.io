<p>I am super excited to begin the technical marketing track of the 
	<a href="http://startupinstitute.com/chicago">Startup Institute</a>.  
	I am excited to learn new things and build on my varied background (telecommunications degree from Ball State, film festival and law firm jobs).  I love to research and tell stories, which I think, makes me an ideal marketer.  When I'm not typing away at my computer, you'll find me watching movies at 
	<a href="http://www.facets.org/">Facets Cinematheque</a> or the 
	<a href="http://www.siskelfilmcenter.org/">Siskel Film Center</a> or cozied up on the couch watching 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show'
