		<h2>Proactive and Organized Storytelling Marketer</h2>
		<p>I am super excited to begin the technical marketing track of the <a href="http://startupinstitute.com/chicago">Startup Institute</a>.  I love to research and tell stories, which I think makes me an ideal marketer.  I spent a handful of years working as part of a small team at the <a href="http://www.trulymovingpictures.org/heartland-film-festival/">Heartland Film Festival</a>.  Most recently, I managed the staff evaluation process and other projects at a large law firm.  During my time at the law firm, I also worked within the IT and marketing departments. I am looking for a new adventure with a passionate and exciting startup team!.</p>
		<p>My ideal job involves researching, planning and implement a great marketing plan, which follows along with my top strengths from the Gallups Strengths finder: Intellection, Learner, Input and Relator.  Like Hannibal from the A-Team, I love it when a plan comes together. I am attracted to startups because I am looking for an environment full of passion, like my early work at a small film festival.  Small teams can accomplish a lot if everyone is excited and self-motivated.  </p>
		<p>When I'm not typing away at my computer, you'll find me watching movies at <a href="http://www.facets.org/">Facets Cinematheque</a> or the
     	<a href="http://www.siskelfilmcenter.org/">Siskel Film Center</a> or cozied up on the couch watching The Mary Tyler Moore Show.  I have been sewing since I was a little girl and learned to crochet a few years ago.  As a result, I have many many handmade bags and scarves.  Would you like me to make you a scarf?</p>
